*No Silver Bullet*

>> In his seminal No Silver Bullet paper, Fred Brooks stated that there is no single development which, by itself, promises one order-of-magnitude improvement in productivity, because technology complexities would decrease, but requested features would not.

According to [https://www.outsystems.com/blog/visual-programming-is-unbelievable.html] the following problems pervail:
- Visual Languages Aren’t Extensible
- Visual Languages Generate Slow Code
- Visual Language Tools Can Be Terrible<br>
  Visual languages and IDEs should be designed together
- Visual Languages Lock You In
- You Are Neurologically Programmed to Reject It<br>
  "why you don’t trust visual languages: The first is related to our love for complexity."
- We’ve Been Here Before
- So, Are We Finally Ready For It?

Like Steve Jobs said: “Simple can be harder than complex. But it’s worth it.”

  

== Failures? ==

- UML -- OO visual
- CASE tools
- SmallTalk
- XCode?
- Prograph: withdrawn from market in late 1990s (TGS Systems)
  "Prograph CPX - A Tutorial: OOPS! Where’d they put all the semicolons?"
- => Marten [http://andescotia.com/products/marten/]

"Because of these instinctive reactions, anything that aims to democratize computing is met with skepticism."
- HyperCard
- Delphi
- Visual Basic
- COBOL
